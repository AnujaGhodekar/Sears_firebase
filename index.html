<h3>U.S. Legal Adult-Use Marijuana Sales Grow 184% in One Year</h3>
<p>U.S. adult-use marijuana sales rose 184% in the past year, according to a new report from New Frontier and ArcView Market Research.

ArcView’s estimate for the legal cannabis industry is $5.4 billion for 2015, a big jump from 2014's $4.6 billion. Most of that increase is due to the incredible growth of recreational marijuana sales which grew from $351 million in 2014 to $998 million in 2015, a 184% increase.

“It is undeniable that cannabis is one of the fastest growing industry in the U.S. Twenty-three states already permit medical cannabis use, along with four states and the District of Columbia allowing full adult use. With nearly a dozen states debating changes to their cannabis laws in the coming year, 2016 will be the tipping point in which a majority of U.S. states transition from cannabis prohibition to some form of regulated legal market,” said New Frontier CEO and Founder Giadha DeCarcer.</p>

<h3>The Nightmare Continues: Banks Using New Payment Standards To Soak Retailers</h3>
  <p>In September I published what I thought were dour statistics on the actual number of retailers that were ready to accept new, more secure credit cards containing embedded chips, under new payment standards taking effect on October 1, and the number of those cards in consumers’ hands. It turns out those dour statistics were very optimistic.

According to a piece published this morning by Greg Buzek, President of IHL Services, only 8.5% of merchants are able to accept the new cards, which he describes as “EMV ready.” At last count, less than 40% of consumer debit and credit cards contained the necessary chip in any case.</p>
